## AR Lab

I had the object be a tree that I put in. It's from "Low Poly Tree Pack" on the Asset Store. I just like the idea of planting things in AR. It could turn into a Hay Day or some kind of garden game within your own home with a reward system or just be part of a natural decorating AR app to make you psychologically feel better becauseof natural elements.
